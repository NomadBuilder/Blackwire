## Facts and Figures for Homepage

### 1. The Scale of the Problem

**Sextortion is a rapidly growing crime:**
- The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) reported **over 26,000 sextortion cases** in 2022, with victims primarily being teenagers and young adults
- Financial sextortion schemes targeting minors have increased dramatically, with many cases involving cryptocurrency payments that make tracking nearly impossible
- The FBI reports that **sextortion is one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes**, with cases increasing significantly year-over-year

- U.S. Department of Justice - Sextortion prosecution cases

### 2. AI's Role in Modern Extortion

**AI is revolutionizing extortion tactics:**

- **AI-Generated Deepfakes**: Criminals are increasingly using AI to create fake nude images and videos, making it easier to target victims without needing real compromising material
- **Automated Targeting**: AI enables criminals to scale their operations, targeting thousands of victims simultaneously through automated messaging and social engineering
- **Sophisticated Phishing**: AI-powered personalized phishing campaigns make extortion attempts more convincing and harder to detect
- **AI Automation**: Global automated scanning activities have increased **16.7% year-on-year to 36,000 scans per second**, showing how AI enables criminals to operate at unprecedented scale

### 3. The Financial Impact

**Extortion generates massive profits:**
- Financial sextortion schemes often demand cryptocurrency payments ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars
- Victims are frequently coerced into making multiple payments, with criminals threatening to escalate exposure
- Cryptocurrency payments make these crimes difficult to trace, emboldening criminals and making recovery nearly impossible

- Blockchain analysis of extortion-related cryptocurrency transactions

### 4. The Human Cost

**This crime has devastating consequences:**
- Sextortion victims face severe psychological trauma, anxiety, depression, and in some tragic cases, suicide
- Victims often feel isolated and ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime
- The threat of exposure affects victims' relationships, education, and employment opportunities
- Minors are particularly vulnerable, with many cases involving teenagers who may not understand the full implications

- Psychological studies on sextortion victim trauma
- FBI victim impact statements
- Mental health organizations tracking extortion-related crises

### 5. Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short

**Infrastructure providers enable these crimes:**
- VOIP services make it nearly impossible to identify perpetrators
- Cryptocurrency wallets provide anonymous payment methods
- Messaging platforms allow criminals to operate across borders
- Domain registrars and hosting providers often ignore abuse reports
- Multiple layers of anonymity make law enforcement investigations extremely difficult

**The BlackWire Approach:**
- **Infrastructure Mapping**: We trace coordinated abuse patterns to identify the service providers enabling these crimes
- **Network Analysis**: We expose how multiple entities connect, revealing larger criminal operations
- **Actionable Intelligence**: We provide the data needed to escalate to infrastructure providers who must be held accountable
